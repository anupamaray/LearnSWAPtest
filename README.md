In this notebook we reproduce Figure 9 for IBM computer ibmq_manila.

Abstract: _Short-depth algorithms are crucial for reducing computational error on near-term quantum computers, for which decoherence and gate infidelity remain important issues. Here we present a machine-learning approach for discovering such algorithms."..."Here, we find algorithms that have shorter depths than the Swap Test, including one that has a constant depth (independent of problem size)." ..."demonstrate that the shorter algorithms that we derive significantly reduce the error—compared to the Swap Test—on these computers._
